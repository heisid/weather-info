# Weather-Info

A simple weather information using HTML geolocation.
JSON endpoint uses [https://fcc-weather-api.glitch.me]

There's still weird bug though, sometimes it show cached data, incorrectly says that our location is in JP. It occures about once in three times.

I still don't know how to fix this, I have ever put ajax flush cache, or something like that. But it didn't work.
